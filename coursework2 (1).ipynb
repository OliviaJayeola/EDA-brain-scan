    "## 1.1 Research topic\n",
    "\n",
    "In my exploratory data analysis (EDA) I explored multiple aspects of data pertaining to Alzheimer's disease (AD), including fMRI data and mental state examination scores, gathered from two different sources. Specifically, I extracted data pertaining to early alzheimer's, which is mild cogntive impairment (MCI) that later converts to Alzheimer's. I aimed to prepare a time series data pipeline that could inform the development of a machine learning or deep learning model to not only predict whether a subject with MCI will convert to AD but also how long it would take, based on the rate of progression within a specified amount of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease that causes memory loss which subsequently leads to the brain being unable to perform vital functions [1]. According to [2], Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia that effects adults in later stages of life, though a genetic form of Alzheimer's can lead to early-onset Alzheimer's. Due to increases in life expectancy cases of AD are projected to triple by 2050 [3], making it a socioeconmic issue as well as a personal health issue. Although there is research being conducted to develop new tratments [4] and there are currently treatments which slow down progression, there is currently no method of reversing or permenantly halting neurodegeneration, thus, it is important for patients to be treated at the earliest stage possible. Unfortunatly, significant neurodegeneration occurs before individuals present with symptoms of AD [5], so a diagnostic critearia must be developed to diagnose indidivuals with early Alzheimer's before they present with symptoms. In 2011, a revised diagnoistic criteria was devised, infromed by empirical evidence, to include the use of neuroimaging techniques to diagnose Alzheimrer's and other forms of dementia [6-7]. Though, detecting biomarkers of Alzheimer's, especially early Alzheimer's, through inspection of images can be difficult as the difference between normal aging and early Alzheimer's is often subtle, additionally, the difference between stable MCI and early Alzheimer's is much more subtle. Recent research has revealed biomarkers that are clear in brain images and only occur within Alzheimer's patients, namely, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [8], however, current neuroimaging techniques required to view these biomarkers can only be performed ex-vivo, in other words, a significant amount of brain tissue must be removed from the body. Although, there is research being conducted to develop in-vivo neuroimaging techniques for these biomarkers [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurodegeneration leads to cognitive impairment and is a normal part of aging, however, there are pathological levels of cogntive imaprment which are diagnosed as MCI and AD. Individuals with MCI often remain stable, however, there are cases where indidivuals with MCI convert to AD. A meta-analyses by Mitchell and Shiri-Feshki revealed that, amongst 41 clinical studies, there was a 33% conversion rate [10], meaning there is a chance that individuals with MCI will convert to AD, making these individuals a good cohort for neuroimaging testing for early Alzheimer's. Another cohort would be individuals who are genetically predisposed to developing Alzheimer's, such as individuals who have family with Alzheimer's or other genetic markers that are connected to Alzherimer's. \n",

    "### 1.1.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n",
    "\n",
    "MRI techniques are a most widely used brain imaging techniques due to it's ability to form detailed images of the brain while being non-invasice and safe; it is also possible to adjust parameters according to the structure of interest, making it a flexible technique. MRI techniques emits a magnetic field which effects the spin of atomic nucleus, as the atoms in different areas of the brain have different properties, namely, the difference between distrubution of water in different brain areas means their will be different distrubutions of hydrogen atoms, causing them to generate different frequencies of energy which is imaged with sub-millimeter resolution [11]. Specifically, an MRI image is formed from the magnetic field gradient of the spin of an atoms nuclei when effected by the magnetic field produced by the MRI. \n",

    "### 1.1.2 Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Statistical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, interest in Artificial Intelligence and advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms, has led to a number of publications in the medical field, as well as many other fields. These algorithms are able to identify parameters that can be used to model data, though it works better when a large amount of data are available as the larger the dataset, the closer the algorithm can model the true pattern. A rule of thumb is often 10 times more data than there are parameters, due to technical issues with degrees of freedom, such as overfitting. This presents a problem for AI applied to the medical field as it is difficult to generate large datasets of sensitive data. Thus, methods have been devised to improve the power of AI when less data is available\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Aims and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "During the EDA a logistic regression model was used to find a model that could fit the data, additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to investigate whether there was a statistical difference between the rate of decay between those who had stable MCI and those who later converted, however, due to the lack of data and possibly also the nature of the data, namely, it being non-linear, a logistic regression model could not be found for this data and the Kruskal-Wallis test did not find a significant difference in rate of decay. Thus, during this project I aim to use more powerful methods to find the function of this data and subsequently build a model that performs better than the previous models used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In the EDA, logistic regression was chosen due to it's flexiblity, namely, it is not reliant on the distribution of the data meeting a certain assumption, so data does not need to be normally distriubted or linearly correlated to the DV. Although logistic regression is a non-linear model it uses the linear regression model to model or fit the data, the prediction or $ \\hat{Y} $ is what is computed via a non-linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\hat{Y}_{i} = \\frac{e^{u}}{1+e^{^{u}}} $\n",
    "where:\n",
    "$ \\hat{Y}_{i} $ is the probability that the ith input (i = 1, ..., n) belongs to one of the classes\n",
    "u is the linear regression model $ A + B_{1}X_{1} + B_{2}X_{2} + ... + B_{k}X_{k} $ which forms the logit $ ln(\\frac{\\hat{Y}}{1-\\hat{Y}}) = A + \\sum B_{j}X_{ij} $ where j = number of coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical model of logistic regression as seen in [13, eq. (10.1 - 10.3)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the linear regression is the natural log of the probability of the input belonging to one class divided by the probability of being in the other group and the coefficients are estimated iteratively using maximum likelihood, similar to neural netowrk models, coefficients are set to small random values and the error is calculated and coefficients are updated to maximize the liklihood of the model fitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, logistic regression is similar to machine and deep learning methods in that it utilises a non-linear function, however, it is only the output that utilises the non-linear function, the data is modelled using linear regression. Thus, this model cannot find non-linear relationships in data.  \n",
    "\n",

    "### 1.2.2 Rate of Atrophy\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation used to model the rate of atrophy $ \\frac{X_{i}-X_{1}}{X_{1}} $ which is a simple equation. During the EDA I performed simple data analysis methods in order to form a benchmark for further analysis. A more advanced methods will be used during this project\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3 Kruskal-Wallis Test\n",
    "\n",
    "During the EDA a Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to examine the differences between MMSE scores according to the conversion group, namely, stable MCI and early Alzheimer's. A significant difference (H=65.88, p<0.01) was found among the 2 samples (group 3, conversion from MCI to AD and group 0, no conversion). A post-hoc test will not be necessary as there are 2 variables, so we know that there is a significant difference between the two variables presented. Thus, MMSE will be used as an input to the model used in this project, along with brain volume data."

Additionally, one of the subjects that obtained an MMSE score of 25 is 90 years old, it is plausible for a 90 year old without dementia to score slightly lower due to normal effects of aging, additionally, there are 38 other 90 year old subjects within this sample. I will keep this subject and others who scored below 25 in the dataset in order to represent the true population of adults ages 50-100"
