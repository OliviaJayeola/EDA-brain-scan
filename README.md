# Machine/Deep learning project using SciKitLearn, Tensorflow and Keras to predict early Alzheimer’s

This project was part of a data programming course during my masters where I got more familiar with data programming in python and SQL. I completed this project before the introduction of chatgpt so I developed strong skills and knowledge of pandas, numpy and tensorflow as well as python programming in general. I spent most of this project writing functions for data cleaning and wrangling/feature engineering. (see 'subjects that converted' section of coursework2 for more details)

I also spent some time learning how to put functions together in tensorflow/keras, how to train an algorithm and get a deeper/advanced understanding of the theory/maths behind deep learning, especially when applied to specific problems like computer vision. I’m also building my skills with sub-classing/object oriented programming in general and specifically with subclassing in tensorflow. I plan to work on an extension to this project where I will use the actual MRI images and model ensembling, I have some understanding/familiarity of the theory behind model ensembling but I’m yet to implement it with tensorflow. I will then get some practice with model deployment and continue developing a deep/advanced understanding of Machine/Deep learning and Artificial intelligence.
