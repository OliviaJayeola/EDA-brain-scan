# Machine/Deep learning project using SciKitLearn, Tensorflow and Keras to predict early Alzheimer’s

This project was part of a data programming course where I got more familiar with data programming in python and SQL. So I spent most of this project cleaning and preparing the data, think the part that took the longest was the first picture, there we’re basically a list of subjects who had MRI’s taken on different days and were given diagnosis’, so I grouped subjects by number of scans and took the first and last subject ID of each group (explain) then I wrote some code to traverse the rows for each subject to see if they converted  . I plan to reimplement this data processing pipeline in SQL just to get some more practice

I haven’t started building custom deep learning algorithms to get better results or anything like that, I’ve recently just been working with tensorflow and Keras to understand how to use it/how to train an algorithm and get a deeper/advanced understanding of the theory/maths behind deep learning, especially when applied to specific problems like computer vision. I’m also building my skills with sub-classing/object oriented programming in general and specifically with subclassing in tensorflow, I’m also starting to develop an understanding of the use of advanced algorithms/architectures used for AI. I think the last thing I’m missing before I move onto advanced architectures/algorithms is model ensembling and hyper parameter optimisation, I have some understanding of the theory behind this but I’m yet to implement it on tensorflow. I plan to continue building my knowledge of tensorflow and AI, going to learn more about deployment and start learning how to use PyTorch and continue developing a deep/advanced understanding of Machine/Deep learning and Artificial intelligence, Im currently interested in AI for computer vision and signal processing (EEG and audio). In the near future I also plan to develop my knowledge of the C/C++ programming language/software/algorithm deployment/ just computer architecture and the software development pipeline in general, I’m not exactly sure what exact role I’m looking for in the future tbh because I’m interested in different aspects of technology especially BCI’s and robotics so for now I’m focused on developing a wide range of skills
