# Machine/Deep learning project using SciKitLearn, Tensorflow and Keras to predict early Alzheimer’s

This project was part of a data programming course where I got more familiar with data programming in python and SQL. Spent most of this project writing functions to clean and prepare the data, think this was the most complex function I've written so far (see 'subjects that converted' section of coursework2 for more details)

I plan to reimplement this data processing pipeline in SQL just to get some more practice.

I haven’t started building custom deep learning algorithms to get better results or anything like that yet, I’ve recently been working with tensorflow and Keras to understand how to use it/how to train an algorithm and get a deeper/advanced understanding of the theory/maths behind deep learning, especially when applied to specific problems like computer vision. I’m also building my skills with sub-classing/object oriented programming in general and specifically with subclassing in tensorflow. I plan to work on an extension to this project where I will use the actual MRI images and model ensembling, I have some understanding/familiarity of the theory behind model ensembling but I’m yet to implement it with tensorflow. I will then get some practice with model deployment and continue developing a deep/advanced understanding of Machine/Deep learning and Artificial intelligence.
