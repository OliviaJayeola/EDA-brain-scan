    "## 1.1 Research Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "In my research proposal I put together databases from ADNI and OCEAN which invovled a range of longitudinal data pertaining to indicivuals with an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis and individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who were eiter later diagnosed with AD or stayed with MCI. I investigated the relationships between variables, in order to  apply a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques andtest their efficacy in predicting MCI cases that would progress to AD/test the predictive power of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "progressive MCI (pMCI) and stable MCI (sMCI). - is there a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disorder that most often occurs in older adults and is the most common form of dementia (https://www.cdc.gov/aging/dementia/index.html#:~:text=Dementia%20is%20not%20a%20specific,a%20part%20of%20normal%20aging.). As life expectancy continues to increase cases of AD are expected to triple by 2050 (Barnes and Yaffe, 2011), which makes it is both a personal health and socioeconomic issue. Though there are new treatments being developed and treatments currently being used, there is currently no cure, therefore the stage of progression of the disease plays a role in the effectiveness of said treatments as they can only slow down progression. The earlier a person can be treated the better quality of life they can have, the problem is that, at present, it is not possible for a human to diagnose AD without analysing symptoms, and by that point they would have already developed significant neurodegeration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitinve decline is a normal part of aging, however MCI is a type of impairment that is more severe than normal aging but less severe than dementia; individuals can recover from MCI or remain stable, they can also develop Alzheimer's after being diagnosed with MCI. At this stage, treatment would greatley effect their quality of life and could even prevent them from developning Alzheimer's but it is unclear what seperates MCI patients who develop AD and those who do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "OCEAN and ADNI have formed datasets from MRI data and a range of information such as education level and cognitve test scores, from participants over a period of years. Recent studies explore different features from these datasets using different SOTA AI algoritms and methods including Convolutional Neural Netowrks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These studies usually report accuracy of the models but do not solely focus on which features would lead to the highest predictive power. Although, one study found higher accuracy when the data was combined with neuropsychological test results (Machine learning framework for early MRI-based Alzheimer's conversion prediction in MCI subjects). To my knwoledge there are no studies which focus solely on the predictive power of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we conducted this Exploratory Data Analysis process is to state the relationship of data explicitly through a graph so that we could assume the correlations before data extraction or data analysis. It might help us to understand the nature of the data and to select the appropriate analysis method for the model later.\n",
    "\n",
    "I aim to predict how many days it may take an individual to develop a certain diagnosis based on their brain scan and MMSE scores. To my knowledge, this factor has not been used in the development of AI models\n",
    "\n",
    "# Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n",
    "\n",
    "MRI is a non-invasive neurimaging technique that relies on the magnetic field of atoms within the brain. \n",
    "Good alternative to techniques such as Positron Electron Tomography which invovles the administration of a radioavtive substance. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/MRIAD.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example of an image produced by an MRI scan. There is a slight difference between these two images, namely, the grey area, knwno as grey and white matter, has significantly atrophied in the subject with Alzheimer's. The aim is to train a ML algorithm to learn the complex pattern between different MRI scans for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "I intend to form a data pipeline to be used for a machine learning algorithm. Data will be grouped on conversion status, namely, whether subjects converted from MCI to AD or remained stable. Insights will be drawn from their brain and intracranial volume data as well as the temporal differences between scans. \n",
    "\n",
    "I aim to collect this data in order to form a ML algorithm that predicts whether a subject with MCI will convert to AD and the amount of days they are predicted to convert."

    "According to the dataframe Subject 0131 from OAS2 converted from MCI to ND, however, their MMSE score decreased from 30 to 25 which would indicate their cognitive mental state decreased significantly. As MMSE scores are interval data I will round the mean values to 0 decimal places, the meam MMSE score for subjects with a CDR of 0 (ND) within this sample is 29 $\\pm$ 1 and 26 $\\pm$ 3 for subjects with a CDR of 0.5\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, their eTIV (estimated total intracranial volume) seems to have decreased between their diagnosis of MCI to AD which suggests that their intracranial volume decreased, however their nWBV values slightly increased. as nWBV represents the percentage of brain volume in the eTIV, the data for this participant suggests that brain volume slightly increased while a feature representing intracranial volume but not brain volume, meninges or cerebrospinal fluid, decreased. However, as eTIV and nWBV are estimated and normalized values it is also possible that there was no significant difference in their brain and intracranial volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I aimed to use the descriptive statistics to see whether these values were within the range for each diagnosis, as I was only looking at the values within each feature I decided to look at the descriptive statistics for eTIV and nWBV to determine whether their brain volume data are within the range of an MCI and ND patient. However, the descriptive statistics show that there is some overlap in the brain volumes of subjects in these groups, there is also overlap in the brain volumes of Subject 0131 with MCI and ND; while they were diagnosed with MCI their nWBV was within 1 standard deviation (std) of the mean of subjects with MCI within this sample, and slightly above the third quartile but not above the maximum value of subjects with MCI within this sample, they were also within 1 std of the mean of subjects with ND within this sample and within the third quartile, this pattern persists for all brain volume data while they were diagnosed with MCI and ND, in other words thier brain volume data seems to be within the range of both MCI and ND samples. \n",

    "As they were given a lower MMSE score, a score indicative of MCI, after converting from a CDR of 0.5 to 0, it is possible that there was a data entry error and this participant was given a CDR of 0 on their first scan and 0.5 on their second scan. It is also possible that they were given a CDR of 0.5 or 0 at both scans. With MMSE scores of 30 and 25 it is more likely that they were given a CDR of 0.5 at both scans. \n",

    "Thus, I will keep this subject in the dataframe for now and keep their values as they are, but I will not perform analysis on converted group 4. There is also not enough data in this group"

    "The aim of this project was to explore variables related to the conversion from MCI to alzheimer's. A data pipeline has been formed which will aid in the development of a algorithms that find patterns in neuroimaging data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be no linear relationship between subjects with MCI who converted to AD and those who didn't. Although this may be due to the small sample size, these results provide grounds for analysis using a more powerful machine learning method that may capture the complex relationship between alzheimer's disease and brain volume.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Kruskal-Wallis test did not find a significant difference in rate of atrophy in the first year, between conversion group 0 and 3. However sample size was small and data was only analysed from first year between scans where the least difference would be observed. More data is needed and also a more sophisticated method of analysing rate of atrophy can be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale used for diagnosis may have caused some limitations in this study, as I used a global CDR rating to classify subjects. Neurodegenerative diseases are complex conditons that vary from individual to indidviual, thus, it is possible that there were variations in the cognitive function of subjects classified as MCI or AD, which may have led to variations in their brain volume. This also applies to the neuroimaging data which were normalised measurements of the whole brain, as alzheimer's primarily effects memory, neuroimaing data specifically targeting the hippocampus may reveal more significant differences between conversion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, modelling the rate of decline in brain volume from one year to the next may reveal more significant differences between conversion groups, this will be explored in further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has discovered a number of factors that could contribute to alzheimer's disease, from unavoidable factors such as air pollution, to changes in protein structures of the brain. There are neuroimaging techniques that are highly invasive and expensive, such as molecular imaging of tau proteins, there are also techniques that are more accessible such as MRI. The aim of this project is to form a data pipeline for medical imaging to make the process of diagnosing alzheimer's quicker and easier. Future projects will be focused on the state-of-the-art ML methods solving this problem."
